                <p class="main-sec-description2">Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet.

                    Web development isn't exactly concerned with the design of a website; rather, it's all about the coding and programming that powers the website's functionality.
                    
                    From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from e-commerce websites to content management systems (CMS)—all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by developers.</p>

Behind this technology is a team of web developers who have not only built it, but constantly maintain it to ensure it works flawlessly.</p>
